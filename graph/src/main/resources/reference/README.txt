                         Graph Options Reference Files
                                 March 17 2010

Overview

The following is a list of the files that must be included in your project if 
you wish to use the Graph Options dialogue feature that is generated by the 
GraphController module.

Ext.ux.tree.CheckTreePanel.css
Ext.ux.tree.CheckTreePanel.js
graph.js

These files should be placed in a single web-accessible directory and included 
on the page that will be generating the graphs by using the following 
directives:

<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/file/Ext.ux.tree.CheckTreePanel.css"/>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/file/Ext.ux.tree.CheckTreePanel.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/file/graph.js"></script>

Note that the necessary Ext libraries must also be included in order to use the 
files that have been included. You must also implement a back end Graph Options 
parameter processing program (such as a Servlet), which will accept the 
parameters that have been set and use those parameters to make a call back to 
the GraphController module.

If you do not wish to use Ext or need to customize the Graph Options dialogue 
for any purpose, feel free to use the included files as an example to write 
your own.
