Cookbooks
=========
OpenEssence has two sets of cookbooks. Third-party cookbooks are managed by 
Librarian and live under **lib**. Cookbooks we maintain live under 
**cookbooks**.

Librarian
---------
Librarian is a package manager for chef cookbooks. Install it with 
`gem install librarian-chef`. Run `librarian-chef install` in the 
**chef/lib/** directory to download the cookbooks.

See https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef for more info.
